## About me
Hi and thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Siiri, a freshly graduated BSc in Computer Science and a master's degree student in Interaction Design.

## About my projects
As you can see, at the moment this profile consists mostly of âœ¨futureâœ¨ projects. This is because I am storing most of my school projects and exercises either locally or in GitLab.

However, here you can find a project I started a short while ago - [Delivery Fee Calculator](https://github.com/siirikapyaho/delivery-fee-calculator) - feel free to have look at how my journey with TypeScript, React and testing is going.

You can also take a peek at my very first Python program, [Movie Theatre Bookin System](https://github.com/siirikapyaho/python-harjoitustyo), from year 2021.

The repositories simple-fortune-cookie and github-action-katas are from my short exchange period at the University of Southern Denmark where I attended an intensive DevOps course by Eficode.

## What's next
I am hoping to start and showcase more interesting projects in the near future. You can expect them to be related in my main interests that take two distinct paths:
- Web and mobile development. I am curious to learn more about how to make different kind of applications attractive and accessible.
- Language models and artificial intelligence. I wrote my bachelor's thesis about ethical questions related to why language models can produce biased text, and my dream would be contributing to more just systems.
